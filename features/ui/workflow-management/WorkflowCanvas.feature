## Component Behaviors

### Feature Block 1: Node Management
```gherkin
Feature: Node Management

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @feature:node-management @type:happy-path @action:create @status:critical
  Scenario: Add new node to workflow
    Given I am editing a workflow in the canvas
    When I drag a "Data Processor" node from the palette
    And I drop it onto the canvas at position (100, 200)
    Then a new Data Processor node should appear at that position
    And the node should be selected automatically
    And the node inspector should show the node properties

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @feature:node-management @type:happy-path @action:edit @status:critical
  Scenario: Edit node properties
    Given I have a node selected on the canvas
    When I change the node name to "Customer Data Filter"
    And I update node configuration settings
    And I confirm the changes
    Then the node should display the new name
    And the node configuration should be saved to workflow definition

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @feature:node-management @type:typical @action:delete @status:critical
  Scenario: Delete node from workflow
    Given I have a node selected on the canvas
    When I press the Delete key or click delete button
    Then the node should be removed from the canvas
    And all connections to/from the node should be removed
    And the workflow definition should be updated
```

---

### Feature Block 2: Connection Management
```gherkin
Feature: Connection Management

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @feature:connections @type:happy-path @action:connect @status:critical
  Scenario: Create connection between nodes
    Given I have two nodes on the canvas
    When I drag from the output port of node A
    And I drop onto the input port of node B
    Then a connection line should appear between the nodes
    And the connection should be added to workflow definition
    And data flow direction should be visually indicated

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @feature:connections @type:validation @action:connect @status:critical
  Scenario: Prevent invalid connections
    Given I am connecting two nodes
    When I try to connect incompatible port types
    Then the connection should be rejected
    And I should see a visual indication of invalid connection
    And an error message should explain the compatibility issue

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @feature:connections @type:typical @action:delete @status:critical
  Scenario: Delete connection
    Given I have a connection between two nodes
    When I click on the connection line
    And I press Delete or click delete button
    Then the connection should be removed
    And the visual line should disappear
    And the workflow definition should be updated
```

### Feature Block 3: Canvas Navigation
```gherkin
Feature: Canvas Navigation

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @feature:navigation @type:typical @action:navigate @status:optional
  Scenario: Pan canvas view
    Given I have a large workflow that extends beyond the visible area
    When I click and drag on empty canvas space
    Then the canvas should pan to show different areas
    And the minimap should update to reflect the current view

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @feature:navigation @type:typical @action:zoom @status:optional
  Scenario: Zoom canvas
    When I use the zoom controls or mouse wheel
    Then the canvas should zoom in or out appropriately
    And all nodes and connections should scale proportionally
    And the minimap should reflect the zoom level

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @feature:navigation @type:typical @action:navigate @status:optional
  Scenario: Fit workflow to screen
    Given I have a workflow with nodes spread across the canvas
    When I click the "Fit to Screen" button
    Then the canvas should zoom and pan to show all nodes
    And the entire workflow should be visible
```

## Error Handling

### Auto-save and Recovery
```gherkin
Feature: Auto-save and Recovery

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @type:auto-save @action:background-save @status:critical
  Scenario: Auto-save workflow changes
    Given I am editing a workflow
    When I make changes to nodes or connections
    Then I should see an "Auto-saved" indicator after 2 seconds
    And changes should be saved to the backend automatically
    And the workflow version should be incremented

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @type:recovery @action:reload @status:critical
  Scenario: Recovery after network interruption
    Given I have unsaved changes in the workflow
    When the network connection is lost and restored
    Then I should see a reconnection indicator
    And unsaved changes should be preserved
    And auto-save should resume when connection is restored
```

### Validation and Error Handling
```gherkin
Feature: Validation and Error Handling

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @type:validation @action:validate @status:critical
  Scenario: Validate workflow structure
    Given I have created a workflow with nodes and connections
    When I attempt to save the workflow
    Then the system should validate workflow integrity
    And highlight any invalid nodes or connections
    And prevent saving if critical errors exist

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @type:error-case @action:load @status:critical
  Scenario: Handle corrupted workflow definition
    Given a workflow has corrupted definition data
    When I try to load the workflow in the canvas
    Then I should see an error message about corruption
    And I should be offered options to recover or create new workflow
    And the canvas should remain functional for new workflows
```

```gherkin
Feature: Performance Monitoring

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @type:performance @action:load @status:critical
  Scenario: Large workflow rendering performance
    Given a workflow with 100+ nodes and 200+ connections
    When I load the workflow in the canvas
    Then the initial render should complete within 2 seconds
    And canvas interactions should remain responsive
    And memory usage should be optimized for large workflows

  @UI @component:WorkflowCanvas @type:performance @action:interaction @status:optional
  Scenario: Smooth interaction performance
    When I drag nodes or create connections
    Then all animations should run at 60fps
    And there should be no noticeable lag in interactions
    And the UI should remain responsive during operations
```
