## Component Behaviors

### Feature Block 1: Real-time Monitoring
```gherkin
Feature: Real-time Monitoring

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @feature:realtime @type:happy-path @action:monitor @status:critical
  Scenario: Display real-time execution updates
    Given I am viewing the execution dashboard
    And there are 3 workflows currently running
    When a new workflow execution starts
    Then the running count should increase to 4
    And the new execution should appear in the active list
    And the "Today's Executions" count should increment
    And updates should happen without page refresh

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @feature:realtime @type:happy-path @action:monitor @status:critical
  Scenario: Update execution status in real-time
    Given I am monitoring an active execution
    When the execution completes successfully
    Then the execution should move from "Running" to "Recent" list
    And the running count should decrease
    And the success rate should be recalculated
    And I should see a visual indication of completion

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @feature:realtime @type:typical @action:monitor @status:critical
  Scenario: Handle execution failures in real-time
    Given I am monitoring executions
    When an execution fails with errors
    Then the execution should appear in the "Failed" list
    And the failure should be highlighted visually
    And I should see error details on hover or click
    And notification should be sent if enabled
```

---

### Feature Block 2: Metrics Display
```gherkin
Feature: Metrics Display

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @feature:metrics @type:happy-path @action:view @status:critical
  Scenario: Display execution metrics accurately
    Given the system has execution history
    With 100 total executions
    And 85 successful executions
    And average duration of 2.3 seconds
    When I view the metrics cards
    Then I should see "Success Rate: 85%"
    And I should see "Average Duration: 2.3s"
    And I should see "100 Total Executions"
    And metrics should update as new executions complete

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @feature:metrics @type:typical @action:filter @status:optional
  Scenario: Filter metrics by date range
    Given I want to see metrics for the last 7 days
    When I select "Last 7 days" from the date filter
    Then all metrics should be recalculated for that period
    And the execution lists should be filtered accordingly
    And the filter selection should be clearly displayed

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @feature:metrics @type:typical @action:view @status:optional
  Scenario: Display execution trends
    When I view the dashboard metrics
    Then I should see trend indicators (up/down arrows)
    Showing how metrics compare to previous period
    And trend colors should indicate positive/negative changes
    And tooltips should explain the trend calculations
```

---

### Feature Block 3: Execution Management
```gherkin
Feature: Execution Management

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @feature:management @type:happy-path @action:select @status:critical
  Scenario: View execution details
    Given I am viewing the execution dashboard
    When I click on a specific execution in the list
    Then I should navigate to the execution detail page
    And see comprehensive execution information
    Including logs, node status, and performance metrics

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @feature:management @type:typical @action:stop @status:critical
  Scenario: Stop running execution
    Given I have a running execution in the dashboard
    When I click the "Stop" button for that execution
    Then I should see a confirmation dialog
    When I confirm the stop action
    Then the execution should be terminated
    And the status should update to "Stopped"
    And it should move to the recent executions list

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @feature:management @type:typical @action:retry @status:optional
  Scenario: Retry failed execution
    Given I have a failed execution in the dashboard
    When I click the "Retry" button
    Then a new execution should start with the same configuration
    And the new execution should appear in running list
    And I should be able to monitor the retry attempt
```

## Error Handling

### Connection and Data Handling
```gherkin
Feature: Connection and Data Handling

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @type:error-case @action:reconnect @status:critical
  Scenario: Handle WebSocket connection loss
    Given I am monitoring executions in real-time
    When the WebSocket connection is lost
    Then I should see a "Connection Lost" indicator
    And the dashboard should attempt automatic reconnection
    And I should be notified when connection is restored
    And missed updates should be fetched on reconnection

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @type:error-case @action:load @status:critical
  Scenario: Handle API errors gracefully
    Given the dashboard is loading execution data
    When the API returns an error
    Then I should see an appropriate error message
    And previously loaded data should remain visible
    And I should have options to retry or refresh
    And the error should not break the entire dashboard

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @type:recovery @action:reload @status:optional
  Scenario: Auto-refresh on error recovery
    Given the dashboard encountered a loading error
    When the error condition is resolved
    Then the dashboard should automatically refresh data
    And all metrics should be updated to current values
    And real-time monitoring should resume
```

## Performance Requirements

### Tags:
`@UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @type:performance @status:critical`

```gherkin
Feature: Performance Monitoring

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @type:performance @action:load @status:critical
  Scenario: Dashboard load performance
    Given the system has 1000+ execution records
    When I load the execution dashboard
    Then the initial render should complete within 2 seconds
    And metrics calculations should not block the UI
    And execution lists should load incrementally if needed

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @type:performance @action:update @status:critical
  Scenario: Real-time update performance
    Given I am receiving frequent execution updates
    When multiple executions update simultaneously
    Then the UI should remain responsive
    And updates should be batched to prevent excessive renders
    And memory usage should remain stable over time
```

      | COUNT(*) FROM executions WHERE status='RUNNING'     | 5     | .running-count          | "5 running workflows"    |
      | AVG(duration) FROM executions WHERE status='SUCCESS'| 2.3   | .avg-duration           | "2.3s average duration"  |
      | COUNT(*) FROM executions WHERE DATE(start)=TODAY()  | 47    | .today-count            | "47 executions today"    |
      | (SUCCESS_COUNT/TOTAL_COUNT)*100                      | 85    | .success-rate           | "85% success rate"       |
    When the dashboard renders metrics
    Then all computed values should display correctly
    And formatting should be consistent and readable

  @UI @component:ExecutionDashboard @type:data-mapping @action:display @status:critical
  Scenario: Map execution list data
    Given execution records from database
      | Field      | Value                  | UI Element               | Transform                    |
