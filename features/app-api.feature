## API Endpoints Specification

### Endpoint Group: Application Root

#### GET /

**Purpose**: Application welcome message and basic health check  
**Authentication**: Public endpoint  

**Response Schema**:
```typescript
interface AppResponse {
  message: string;
}
```

**Tags for Endpoint**:
`@API @endpoint:app-root @action:GET @status:optional @type:health-check`

**API Behaviors**:
```gherkin
Feature: Application Root API

  @API @endpoint:app-root @action:GET @type:happy-path @status:optional
  Scenario: Get application welcome message
    When I send GET / 
    Then I should receive status code 200
    And the response should contain a welcome message
    And the response should be a string

  @API @endpoint:app-root @action:GET @type:health-check @status:optional
  Scenario: Basic application health check
    When I send GET /
    Then I should receive status code 200
    And the response should be returned within 100ms
    And the application should be responsive

  @API @endpoint:app-root @action:GET @type:availability @status:optional
  Scenario: Application accessibility
    Given the application is running
    When I send GET / from any client
    Then the endpoint should be publicly accessible
    And no authentication should be required
    And the response should indicate the application is running
```

## Error Handling and Status Codes

### Tags:
`@API @type:error-handling @status:optional`

```gherkin
Feature: Application Root Error Handling

  @API @type:error-handling @action:GET @status:optional
  Scenario: Handle application unavailability
    Given the application service is down
    When I send GET /
    Then I should receive appropriate error response
    And the client should be informed of service unavailability

  @API @type:error-handling @action:any @status:optional
  Scenario: Handle unsupported HTTP methods
    When I send POST, PUT, or DELETE to /
    Then I should receive 405 Method Not Allowed
    And the response should indicate supported methods
```

## Performance Requirements

### Tags:
`@API @type:performance @status:optional`

```gherkin
Feature: Application Root Performance

  @API @type:performance @action:GET @status:optional
  Scenario: Root endpoint response time
    When I send GET /
    Then response time should be less than 50ms
    And the response should be immediately available

  @API @type:performance @action:GET @status:optional
  Scenario: High availability for root endpoint
    Given the application is under normal load
    When multiple clients access GET / simultaneously
    Then all requests should be served successfully
    And response times should remain consistent
```

---

## Monitoring and Observability

### Tags:
`@API @type:monitoring @status:optional`

```gherkin
Feature: Application Root Monitoring

  @API @type:monitoring @action:GET @status:optional
  Scenario: Root endpoint logging
    When I send GET /
    Then the request should be logged appropriately
    And access patterns should be trackable
    And performance metrics should be captured

  @API @type:monitoring @action:GET @status:optional
  Scenario: Health check integration
    When monitoring systems check GET /
    Then the endpoint should provide reliable health indication
    And the response should be consistent and predictable
    And the endpoint should be suitable for load balancer health checks
```

---

## Integration Requirements

### Tags:
`@API @type:integration @status:optional`

```gherkin
Feature: Application Root Integration

  @API @type:integration @action:GET @status:optional
  Scenario: Load balancer compatibility
    Given the application is behind a load balancer
    When the load balancer performs health checks on GET /
    Then the endpoint should respond consistently
    And the load balancer should correctly identify healthy instances

  @API @type:integration @action:GET @status:optional
  Scenario: CORS handling for root endpoint
    When I send GET / from a web browser
    Then appropriate CORS headers should be included if configured
    And cross-origin requests should be handled properly

  @API @type:integration @action:GET @status:optional
  Scenario: Reverse proxy compatibility
    Given the application is behind a reverse proxy
    When I access GET / through the proxy
    Then the endpoint should respond correctly
    And proxy headers should be handled appropriately
```

## Security Considerations

### Tags:
`@API @type:security @status:optional`

```gherkin
Feature: Application Root Security

  @API @type:security @action:GET @status:optional
  Scenario: Information disclosure protection
    When I send GET /
    Then the response should not reveal sensitive system information
    And the response should not expose internal application details
    And the response should be safe for public consumption

  @API @type:security @action:GET @status:optional
  Scenario: Rate limiting considerations
    When I send multiple requests to GET /
    Then the endpoint should handle high request volumes gracefully
    And appropriate rate limiting should be applied if necessary
    And the endpoint should not be vulnerable to abuse

  @API @type:security @action:GET @status:optional
  Scenario: Security headers
    When I send GET /
    Then appropriate security headers should be included
    And the response should follow security best practices
    And common security vulnerabilities should be mitigated
